#summary A list of potential things to fix for Power*MatchMaker 0.9.4 RC 2.

==Notable Power*MatchMaker Commits since RC 1==
  * (Commited) r2026 - Fixed date comparison to work with java.sql.Date/Time/Timestamp in addition to java.util.Date. Added tests to ensure this behaviour doesn't break over time
  * r2027 - Fixed bug that made it impossible to create a repository in MySQL


==Notable Not-marked-as-fixed Power*MatchMaker bugs in BugZilla since RC 1==
  * Bug 1649 - User-defined custom unique keys on the match table doesn't get saved with the project. If you load the project, only the existing unique keys get loaded. The user-defined key is saved in the repository, but is not loaded
  * Bug 1650 - Power*MatchMaker throws NPE if clicking on 'Pick Columns' button on a match table with no unique key (this may have been fixed already)
  * Haven't reproduced this error yet but: http://www.sqlpower.ca/forum/posts/list/2089.page


==Notable Commits to SQL Power Library since RC 1 that may affect MatchMaker==
  * 636 - Removed check for missing username in attempt to get SQL Server integrated security logins working
  * 696 - Split up DBMD wrappers for SQL Server 2000 and 2005 because optimal way of listing schemas is different between the two platforms. See http://www.sqlpower.ca/forum/posts/list/0/1788.page for details.

==Notable Not-marked-as-fixed Bugs in SQL Power Library since RC 1==
  * Bug 1693 - Need SQL Server driver to strips parentheses from default value
