#summary A list of potential things to fix for Power*MatchMaker 0.9.4 RC 2.

==Notable Power*MatchMaker Commits since RC 1==
  * r2018 - Update to the commons libraries, namely commons-collections to support the new JDBC metadata caching functionality.
  * r2026 - Fixed date comparison to work with java.sql.Date/Time/Timestamp in addition to java.util.Date. Added tests to ensure this behaviour doesn't break over time
  * 2027 - Fixed bug that made it impossible to create a repository in MySQL


==Notable Not-marked-as-fixed Power*MatchMaker bugs in BugZilla since RC 1==
  * Bug 1649 - User-defined custom unique keys on the match table doesn't get saved with the project. If you load the project, only the existing unique keys get loaded. The user-defined key is saved in the repository, but is not loaded
  * Bug 1650 - Power*MatchMaker throws NPE if clicking on 'Pick Columns' button on a match table with no unique key (this may have been fixed already)
