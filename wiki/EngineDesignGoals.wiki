Engine Requirements

  * Ability to handle millions of records
  * Easy API for contributing new match rule
    * Divide into steps (lego pieces) 
      * Allow creation of custom steps and custom groups of steps
      * _Transformation of steps into SQL functions_
    * Support custom Java Script and Regular Expressions
  * Data-types we would support for munging:
    * Boolean
    * String
    * Number
    * Date/Time
    * Time interval
  * Design the engines so that the work can be distributed across network nodes
  * Engines' incremental process should have:
    * A progress bar
    * A show details option (i.e. current record)
    * Ability to cancel the process
  * Use filters on match steps so it only applies to specific records
    * Initial filters to use where clauses in query
    * i.e. Dealing with postal codes from Canada, U.S., other countries
  * Machine learning
    * Add change listener on match validation step
    * String permutation relevance to percentage of match
  * Methods of matching could be used in match process (steps 4, 5)
    * Exact match
    * Rough sets
    * Comparing by words in common
  * Use predecessor search to order the steps so that each step need to be run only once
    * First use a depth search to eliminate the nodes that do nothing first
  * Steps we want
    * Sort all the letters to find transpositions
    * Sort all the words to find transpositions
    * Consider nulls are equal
    * Convert to upper and lower case
    * String substitution (list of characters)
    * Retain characters
    * Translate words
    * Substring by word
    * Substring
    * Soundex
    * Enhanced soundex
    * Word count
  * We need a row type so that is can be passed into a list (it will just hold an array of objects)
  * Munge preview
    * While your working choose either a random table row, or user entered test data and show a preview of what the munge will do to it.
  * Threading
    * Allow the user to specify the number of threads to be run
    * Each thread will process individual rows in the database
  
Overall Match Engine Process

  # Columns <- key columns + all columns referenced by match rule sets
  # Select columns from table for each rule set
  # Munge
  # Sort
  # Walk through list 
  # Match validation
  # Store results back to match result table
