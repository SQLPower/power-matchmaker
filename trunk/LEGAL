Linking Power*MatchMaker statically or dynamically with other modules is making
a combined work based on Power*MatchMaker.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

In addition, as a special exception, SQL Power gives
you permission to combine Power*MatchMaker program with free software
programs or
libraries that are released under the GNU LGPL and with the standard
release of the Java(TM) Transaction API (JTA) reference implementation
from Sun Microsystems, Inc. (or modified
versions of such code, with unchanged license).  You may copy and
distribute such a system following the terms of the GNU GPL for Power*MatchMaker
and the licenses of the other code concerned.

As an additional special exception, SQL Power gives you permission to
use Power*MatchMaker together with publically available JDBC drivers
whether or not they are licensed compatibly with the GPL.

As a final special exception, SQL Power gives you permission to use
Power*MatchMaker together with any release of the JUnit test
framework, which is licensed under the Common Public License (CPL).

Note that people who make modified versions of Power*MatchMaker are
not obligated
to grant this special exception for their modified versions; it is
their choice whether to do so.  The GNU General Public License gives
permission to release a modified version without this exception; this
exception also makes it possible to release a modified version which
carries forward this exception.
