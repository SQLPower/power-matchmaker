			<section id="Introduction.Basic_Concepts.Drivers">
				<title>Drivers</title>
				<para>
					Most programs need a distinct driver program to
					communicate with each different type of database.
					The Power*Matchmaker uses Java-based drivers, which
					normally come from the database vendor in the form
					of "JAR"
					<footnote>
						<para>
							Java Archive files; these are an extension
							to the file format used by PKZip/WinZip
							archives
						</para>
					</footnote>
					files. You need to inform Power*Matchmaker about
					each driver before you can use it; do this from the
					JDBC Drivers window that can be accessed from the
					Database Connection Manager window. If you do not
					have the JDBC driver for a given database, you can
					usually obtain one from the database vendor. If that
					fails, you can find a directory of databases drivers
					on
					<ulink
						url="http://developers.sun.com/product/jdbc/drivers">
						Sun&apos;s web site

				The tie-in between Drivers and Connections might seem a

				the drivers are so that they can be used when necessary.
				Definition of the database type must be completed before
				a new database connection can be configured.
			</para>

				Clicking on the Manage Connections... button will open
				the Database Connection Manager window. In this window
				click on JBDC drivers button to define a database
				connection. The JDBC drivers window will appear as shown

			<para>
				The column on the left hand side contains a list of
				pre-defined database connection types. To connect to one
				of the pre-defined database connections you must first
				tell Power*MatchMaker where to find the JAR file.
				Highlight the desired database type in the left column,
				click on the Add JAR... button, and navigate to the
				correct JAR file for the database type. The Add JAR...
				and Remove JAR buttons are used to point the
				Power*MatchMaker to the locations of the JAR files that
				contain the proper JDBC Driver. Once, you select a JAR
				file, if there is a valid driver in it, a file tree will
				appear in the area below the buttons. This is a
				representation of the JAR file and its JDBC contents.
				Select the driver you wish to use and click the "OK"
				button at the bottom.

			<para>
				<emphasis>Connection String Template</emphasis>
				Used to define a URL template. The URL template is used
				by the Power*MatchMaker to create a URL that is used to
				attempt a database connection. The pattern that the
				string must conform to is not trivial but is made up of
				two simpler parts, literals and variables. Literals are
				entered like normal text but may not contain angle
				brackets (&lt; or &gt;) because they are reserved for
				defining variables. As their name implies, literals
				appear in the URL in the same position and way they
				appear in the template. Variables are used to make it
				easier for things that change such as the schema or
				database name you wish to connect to. They are defined
				in the template by
				"&lt;variable_name:default_value&gt;". Once a variable
				is defined in the template, a field labeled with the
				variable's name will appear below with the default value
				in it just below the template as a preview to what you
				will later be able to modify in "Connection Properties".
			</para>

			<para>
				Note: Default values are often useful, but are optional.
				If you do not want a variable to have a default value,
				define it as "&lt;variable_name&gt;". The default value
				for these variables is blank. For example, if we wanted
				to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database, the URL
				template might look like
				"jdbc:sqlserver://&lt;Hostname&gt;:&lt;Port:1433&gt;".
				The URL this template will output is
				"jdbc:sqlserver://:1433" where the 1433 was a default
				value. If we were to enter "localhost" in the Hostname
				field, we would get the URL
				"jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433". By defining the
				"Hostname" variable, we make it easier and quicker to
				connect to a generic SQL Server instance. SQL Server
				databases listen to port 1433 by default but can be
				configured to listen to others so, by giving the
				variable this default, we can have the most common value
				inserted automatically while allowing us to modify what
				is in the field to change the port in specific cases.

				patent infringement, then any patent licenses granted to
				You under this License for that Work shall terminate as
				of the date such litigation is filed.

				4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute
				copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any
				medium, with or without modifications, and in Source or
				Object form, provided that You meet the following
				conditions:

				(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or

				excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part
				of the Derivative Works, in at least one of the
				following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
				as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form
				or documentation, if provided along with the Derivative
				Works; or, within a display generated by the Derivative
				Works, if and wherever such third-party notices normally
				appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are for
				informational purposes only and do not modify the
				License. You may add Your own attribution notices within
				Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside or as an
				addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided that
				such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
				as modifying the License.

				You may add Your own copyright statement to Your
				modifications and may provide additional or different
				license terms and conditions for use, reproduction, or
				distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
				Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
				reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise
				complies with the conditions stated in this License.

				5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly
				state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
				submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
				Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this

				"AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
				KIND, either express or implied, including, without
				limitation, any warranties or conditions of TITLE,
				NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
				PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for
				determining the appropriateness of using or
				redistributing the Work and assume any risks associated
				with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

				8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no
				legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence),
				contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable
				law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or
				agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to
				You for damages, including any direct, indirect,
				special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
				character arising as a result of this License or out of
				the use or inability to use the Work (including but not
				limited to damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage,
				computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
				commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
				has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

				9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While
				redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You
				may choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of
				support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
				obligations and/or rights consistent with this License.
				However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
				on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not
				on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You
				agree to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor
				harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
				asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
				accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

				GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

				Version 3, 29 June 2007

				Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
				&lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;

				Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
				copies of this license document, but changing it is not
				allowed.

				This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License
				incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of
				the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the
				additional permissions listed below. 0. Additional
				Definitions.

				As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of
				the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL”
				refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

				“The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this
				License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as
				defined below.

				An “Application” is any work that makes use of an
				interface provided by the Library, but which is not
				otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a
				class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using
				an interface provided by the Library.

				A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or
				linking an Application with the Library. The particular
				version of the Library with which the Combined Work was
				made is also called the “Linked Version”.

				The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work
				means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work,
				excluding any source code for portions of the Combined
				Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the
				Application, and not on the Linked Version.

				The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work
				means the object code and/or source code for the
				Application, including any data and utility programs
				needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
				Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the
				Combined Work. 1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.

				You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of
				this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU
				GPL. 2. Conveying Modified Versions.

				If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your
				modifications, a facility refers to a function or data
				to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility
				(other than as an argument passed when the facility is
				invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
				version:

				* a) under this License, provided that you make a good
				faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application
				does not supply the function or data, the facility still
				operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose
				remains meaningful, or * b) under the GNU GPL, with none
				of the additional permissions of this License applicable
				to that copy.

				3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library
				Header Files.

				The object code form of an Application may incorporate
				material from a header file that is part of the Library.
				You may convey such object code under terms of your
				choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is
				not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
				layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions
				and templates (ten or fewer lines in length), you do
				both of the following:

				* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object
				code that the Library is used in it and that the Library
				and its use are covered by this License. * b) Accompany
				the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this
				license document.

				4. Combined Works.

				You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your
				choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict
				modification of the portions of the Library contained in
				the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging
				such modifications, if you also do each of the
				following:

				* a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the
				Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that
				the Library and its use are covered by this License. *
				b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU
				GPL and this license document. * c) For a Combined Work
				that displays copyright notices during execution,
				include the copyright notice for the Library among these
				notices, as well as a reference directing the user to
				the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document. *
				d) Do one of the following: o 0) Convey the Minimal
				Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
				and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
				suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
				recombine or relink the Application with a modified
				version of the Linked Version to produce a modified
				Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of
				the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source. o 1) Use
				a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
				Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at
				run time a copy of the Library already present on the
				user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly
				with a modified version of the Library that is
				interface-compatible with the Linked Version. * e)
				Provide Installation Information, but only if you would
				otherwise be required to provide such information under
				section 6 of the GNU GPL, and only to the extent that
				such information is necessary to install and execute a
				modified version of the Combined Work produced by
				recombining or relinking the Application with a modified
				version of the Linked Version. (If you use option 4d0,
				the Installation Information must accompany the Minimal
				Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application Code.
				If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
				Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the
				GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.)

				5. Combined Libraries.

				You may place library facilities that are a work based
				on the Library side by side in a single library together
				with other library facilities that are not Applications
				and are not covered by this License, and convey such a
				combined library under terms of your choice, if you do
				both of the following:

				* a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the
				same work based on the Library, uncombined with any
				other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of
				this License. * b) Give prominent notice with the
				combined library that part of it is a work based on the
				Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying
				uncombined form of the same work.

				6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public
				License.

				The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
				new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License
				from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in
				spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail
				to address new problems or concerns.

				Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
				If the Library as you received it specifies that a
				certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General
				Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you
				have the option of following the terms and conditions
				either of that published version or of any later version
				published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
				Library as you received it does not specify a version
				number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may
				choose any version of the GNU Lesser General Public
				License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

				If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy
				can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser
				General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public
				statement of acceptance of any version is permanent
				authorization for you to choose that version for the
				Library.

				(or portions thereof), either on an unmodified basis,
				with other Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as
				part of a Larger Work; and

				(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using,
				or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor
				either alone and/or in combination with its Contributor
				Version (or portions of such combination), to make, use,
				sell, offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise
				dispose of: (1) Modifications made by that Contributor
				(or portions thereof); and (2) the combination of
				Modifications made by that Contributor with its
				Contributor Version (or portions of such combination).

				(c) The licenses granted in Sections 2.2(a) and 2.2(b)
				are effective on the date Contributor first distributes
				or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a
				third party.

				(d) Notwithstanding Section 2.2(b) above, no patent
				license is granted: (1) for any code that Contributor
				has deleted from the Contributor Version; (2) for
				infringements caused by: (i) third party modifications
				of Contributor Version, or (ii) the combination of
				Modifications made by that Contributor with other
				software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or
				other devices; or (3) under Patent Claims infringed by
				Covered Software in the absence of Modifications made by
				that Contributor.

				3. Distribution Obligations.

				3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software
				that You distribute or otherwise make available in
				Executable form must also be made available in Source
				Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed
				only under the terms of this License. You must include a
				copy of this License with every copy of the Source Code
				form of the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise
				make available. You must inform recipients of any such
				Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can
				obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
				reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily
				used for software exchange.

				3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or
				to which You contribute are governed by the terms of
				this License. You represent that You believe Your
				Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or You
				have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by
				this License.

				3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each
				of Your Modifications that identifies You as the
				Contributor of the Modification. You may not remove or
				alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
				contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of
				licensing or any descriptive text giving attribution to
				any Contributor or the Initial Developer.

				3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer
				or impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source
				Code form that alters or restricts the applicable
				version of this License or the recipients rights
				hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to charge a fee
				for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
				obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
				Software. However, you may do so only on Your own
				behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or
				any Contributor. You must make it absolutely clear that
				any such warranty, support, indemnity or liability
				obligation is offered by You alone, and You hereby agree
				to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
				for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
				such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
				indemnity or liability terms You offer.

				3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may
				distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software
				under the terms of this License or under the terms of a
				license of Your choice, which may contain terms
				different from this License, provided that You are in
				compliance with the terms of this License and that the
				license for the Executable form does not attempt to
				limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code
				form from the rights set forth in this License. If You
				distribute the Covered Software in Executable form under
				a different license, You must make it absolutely clear
				that any terms which differ from this License are
				offered by You alone, not by the Initial Developer or
				Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
				Developer and every Contributor for any liability
				incurred by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as
				a result of any such terms You offer.

				3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by
				combining Covered Software with other code not governed
				by the terms of this License and distribute the Larger
				Work as a single product. In such a case, You must make
				sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled for
				the Covered Software.

				4. Versions of the License.

				4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial
				license steward and may publish revised and/or new
				versions of this License from time to time. Each version
				will be given a distinguishing version number. Except as
				provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
				steward has the right to modify this License.

				4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to
				use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software
				available under the terms of the version of the License
				under which You originally received the Covered
				Software. If the Initial Developer includes a notice in
				the Original Software prohibiting it from being
				distributed or otherwise made available under any
				subsequent version of the License, You must distribute
				and make the Covered Software available under the terms
				of the version of the License under which You originally
				received the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also
				choose to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
				Software available under the terms of any subsequent
				version of the License published by the license steward.

				4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial
				Developer and You want to create a new license for Your
				Original Software, You may create and use a modified
				version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
				and remove any references to the name of the license
				steward (except to note that the license differs from
				this License); and (b) otherwise make it clear that the
				license contains terms which differ from this License.

				5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED
				UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY
				OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING,
				WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
				IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR
				PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
				QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH
				YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE IN ANY
				RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER
				CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
				REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY
				CONSTITUTES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF
				ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT
				UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

				6. TERMINATION.

				6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will
				terminate automatically if You fail to comply with terms
				herein and fail to cure such breach within 30 days of
				becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
				nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of
				this License shall survive.

				6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim
				(excluding declaratory judgment actions) against Initial
				Developer or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or
				Contributor against whom You assert such claim is
				referred to as Participant) alleging that the
				Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version
				where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
				Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer)
				directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any
				and all rights granted directly or indirectly to You by
				such Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial
				Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
				under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall,
				upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate
				prospectively and automatically at the expiration of
				such 60 day notice period, unless if within such 60 day
				period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
				Participant Software against such Participant either
				unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
				Participant.

				6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or
				6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been validly
				granted by You or any distributor hereunder prior to
				termination (excluding licenses granted to You by any
				distributor) shall survive termination.

				7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND
				UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING
				NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
				INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY
				DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY
				OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY
				INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES
				OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES
				FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
				COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
				COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL
				HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
				THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO
				LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM
				SUCH PARTYS NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
				PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
				ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR
				CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION
				MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

				8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a
				commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R.
				2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer
				software (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R.
				252.227-7014(a)(1)) and commercial computer software
				documentation as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212
				(Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48
				C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all
				U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software with
				only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government
				Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other
				FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses
				Government rights in computer software under this
				License.

				9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete
				agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any
				provision of this License is held to be unenforceable,
				such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
				necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be
				governed by the law of the jurisdiction specified in a
				notice contained within the Original Software (except to
				the extent applicable law, if any, provides otherwise),
				excluding such jurisdictions conflict-of-law provisions.
				Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
				to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the
				jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice contained
				within the Original Software, with the losing party
				responsible for costs, including, without limitation,
				court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.
				The application of the United Nations Convention on
				Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is
				expressly excluded. Any law or regulation which provides
				that the language of a contract shall be construed
				against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
				agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with
				the United States export administration regulations (and
				the export control laws and regulation of any other
				countries) when You use, distribute or otherwise make
				available any Covered Software.

				10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial
				Developer and the Contributors, each party is
				responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or
				indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this
				License and You agree to work with Initial Developer and
				Contributors to distribute such responsibility on an
				equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or shall be
				deemed to constitute any admission of liability.
