0.9.3
* GUI Enhancements:
  - 'Choose Displayed Column' dialog now resizes properly
  - Munge process connectors are positioned better, especially if an output is positioned below its corresponding input.
  - Added a 'Clear' button on the 'Run Match' and 'Run Merge' Engine screens that clears the output log
  - Fixed some munge steps that were not properly saving their parameters
  - New Munge Processes should default to a new colour
  - 'Users Preferences' and 'Exit' options added back to the File Menu
  - Added ability to choose which Munge Processes get shown in the Match Validation graph
  - Null values are printed in grey in the Match Validation graph and table,
  - You can  now choose which column values to display in the Match Validation table
  - Improved readability of the Merge Engine logs
* Added PDF Export of the Munge Pen
* Auto-login can be used on other repositories other than the default HSQLDB one.
* If you have multiple Power*MatchMaker application windows open, closing one no longer closes the whole application
* Prompts for saving unsaved changes in the current editor when closing a main application window
* You can now select which Munge Processes in a Project to run in the Match Engine
* Improved User Guide. Main changes include rewordings, minor markup adjustments, better image sizing, and the addition of two images that were missing in the previous draft.
* Power*MatchMaker can now update your repository schema if it is out of date
* Improved support for MySQL
* Improved match engine performance on Oracle 10g
* Automated project adaption to source table changes
* Many bug fixes.


0.9.2

* Added a user preference for auto-login into a repository. The user can choose to log in automatically into a repository of their
choice, or have the application prompt the user for a repository each time they start the application.
* Added some new munge steps, including data type conversion steps (ex. Date-to-String), and a CSV writer step
* It is now possible to specify a set of columns to use as the unqiue index, even if the table doesn't have a primary key or unique index.
* The example table can now be created properly in HSQLDB
* Matching, merging, and cleansing projects now fully work in HSQLDB


0.9.1

* Changed the default login process to log into (and first create if necessary) a local HSQLDB repository database.  This greatly simplifies the process of getting started for new users.
* Fixed a serious bug that prevented creating a new repository schema.
* When all the input connections for a Munge Step are used up, an empty one is automatically generated if the step supports
  adding new inputs. Unconnected inputs for these steps are now treated as if they didn't exist, so that the use isn't
  forced to clean up these inputs before running the engines.
* Fixed a bug that could result in the MatchMaker using up all available database connections.
* Temporarily removed the X-Ref project option until it is fully implemented.
* In the Match Validation screen, the source table record for the node you have selected in the graph will not scroll 
  off the screen when you scroll through the source table records. This makes it easier to compare the record you have
  selected with the other potential duplicate records.


0.9.0

* Initial open-source release


Wish List of Future Features (see also our Bugzilla bug tracker at http://trillian.sqlpower.ca/bugzilla/)

* Don't require updatable result sets when they're unavailable (HSQLDB doesn't support them)
* Create a "tips" facility which will pop up a new helpful tip every time the app is started.
  Tips should be presented in increasing level of sophistication.  For example:
   -The best way to get started is to watch the walkthrough movie on the SQL Power web site. (live link to wink demo)
   -Learn more about the MatchMaker by working through the example in the "A Simple Example" chapter of the user guide.
   -Define connections to your databases using the Databases->Manage Database Conncetions... menu item.
   -If you are working together with others, you can create a shared repository in any database.  Use the Databases->Create Repository... menu item to create one.
