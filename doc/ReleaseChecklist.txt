                     SQL Power DQguru release checklist

$Id: ReleaseChecklist.txt 1878 2007-10-29 15:23:22Z jfuerth $

This file is intended as a guide for the person who is packaging, posting,
and announcing a new release of the SQL Power DQguru.  This list is probably
not complete.  If you find yourself performing a step that is not mentioned
here, please add it!

The items listed here are intended to be in a sensible chronological order.
If working from top to bottom paints you into a corner, adjust the order so
that the next person won't run into the same problem.

Good luck with the release!


*Comment out all the logging configs set to DEBUG (leave the RootLogger at INFO)
*Update the ca.sqlpower.matchmaker.MatchMakerVersion class to reflect the correct
 release number.  Normally, this will mean setting the suffix to "" for a full
 release, or "beta", "rc1", etc for a pre-release.
*Run the MatchMakerAllTests suite. It should pass with a flying colour (green)
*Build the distribution (build.xml target "dist"). For an official release, this
 has to be done on OS X, since the tools for creating the dmg disk image file are
 unavailable elsewhere.
*Test the three flavours of binaries (Generic tarball, OS X disk image, Windows
 installer) for the following:
 *Rename your PL.INI file so you get the "new user experience"
 *File size is close to the expected size (it was 12~13MB in 0.9.0)
 *Archive expands properly or installer works as expected
 *Try connecting to all databases that the MatchMaker is preconfigured for (MySQL,
  PostgreSQL, SQL Server, HSQLDB)
 *Try adding the Oracle driver to the driver manager then connect to an Oracle
  database
 *Try creating a new database type from scratch (it could just be a new config for
  one of the existing types)
 *Ensure the online help is present
 *Scan through the PDF documentation. Ensure the pictures are included properly
  (not stretched, properly cropped)
 *Try going through a complete match and merge procedure. If you need details on how
  to do this, and/or you need an example table to test on, consult the user guide.
 *Make sure the app quits once all windows have been closed
 *For Windows only, test the uninstaller
*Commit, then tag the release in the SVN repository, if you made it all the way
 to this point without finding any new problems!
