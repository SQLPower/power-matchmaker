			<section id="getting_started.basic_concepts.munge">

				<title>Munge</title>

				<para>
					Munge processes are used to transform and manipulate

					Power*MatchMaker will run each record from the
					source table through the munge processes you've
					defined for the project.
				</para>


				<para>
					Within a project, you can create one or more munge
					processes. A munge process must have at least one
					input step (usually the source table) and output
					step (either a results table or the source table),
					plus one or more intermediary steps that are used to
					transform data. You can use the following types of
					munge steps:
				</para>





				<itemizedlist>

					<listitem>
						<para>
							Concatenation - Joins the contents of
							multiple inputs. The output is the result of
							the join.

				<title>Merge</title>

				<para>
					Merge rules are used to combine duplicate records

					merge rules (a collection of column merge rules that
					apply to a table).
				</para>


				<itemizedlist>

												When you create a

				<title>Defining the JDBC Driver</title>

				<para>
					Whether you are adding a new database platform to
					Power*MatchMaker or want to use one of the
					pre-configured platforms, the last step in setting
					up a database type is to locate the JAR file (or
					files) that contain the JDBC drivers for the
					database platform.
				</para>

				<para>
					Note: At this point, you are just telling
					Power*MatchMaker where the drivers are. You must set
					up a database connection in order to connect to a
					specific database (for more information, see
					<xref linkend="setup_database.connections" />
					).
				</para>

				<para>
					Unlike most applications, which need a distinct
					driver program to communicate with each type of
					database, Power*MatchMaker uses Java-based drivers.
					These drivers normally come from the database vendor
					in the form of JAR (Java Archive) files. JAR files
					are an extension to the file format used by
					PKZip/WinZip archives.
				</para>

				<para>
					Most database platforms provide drivers that are
					fully backward compatible. This means that it is
					best to use the newest driver available, regardless
					of the software version on the specific database
					server you intend to connect to. One exception to
					this is the Oracle database. It is important to
					match the major version number of your JDBC driver
					with the major version number of the Oracle database
					server you connect to. For example, if you are
					connecting to an Oracle 10g database, use the latest
					Oracle 10g driver. If you are connecting to an
					Oracle 9i database, use the Oracle 9i driver.

			<title>About Repositories</title>

			<para>

				Your Power*MatchMaker projects are saved in a special
				data store called a repository. The first time you run
				Power*MatchMaker, a local repository is created for you
				automatically, called the MatchMaker Default Repository.
				The repository itself is actually a relational database
				schema and is stored in an embedded database, located in
				a directory called .mm (notice the leading dot) within
				your home directory. On Unix systems, you can find your
				home directory by issuing a cd command with no
				arguments. On Windows systems, your home directory is
				usually in C:\Documents and Settings\
				<emphasis>Your Name</emphasis>
				. Be sure to backup this repository regularly. Simply
				make a copy of the .mm directory when Power*MatchMaker
				is not running and save this copy in a safe location.

			</para>

			<para>

				There are many advantages to using this local
				repository: you don't require a network connection, you
				can easily backup and restore the repository, it's fast,
				and it's already been set up for you. However, there are
				times you may want to save your work in a remote, shared
				repository. For instance, if you are working on a large
				Find Duplicates project as part of a team, you may want
				to divide up the work and tackle it in parallel. Or if
				your cleansing process is part of a nightly maintenance
				routine that runs on a server, you may want to point the
				routine to the same repository you work in. Or perhaps
				there is a DBA at your organization who makes backups
				nightly and your project data would be safer in her
				system than it would be in a local database on your
				workstation or laptop.

			</para>

			<para>

				If you decide to use a remote repository, you must
				create the repository, then connect to it using
				Power*MatchMaker. See the following sections for
				details.

				<title>Create a Database and User</title>

				<para>

					Before creating a remote repository, you must decide
					where to store it. Storing a shared repository on a
					workstation is not recommended for several reasons.
					The entire team will rely on one person's
					workstation, and that person will be responsible for
					keeping their system up and running and performing
					regular backups of the repository database. They
					will also be inconvenienced when the database
					software needs to be upgraded. Hosting the
					repository on a dedicated database server is a much
					better choice.

				</para>

				<para>

					Once you've chosen a location, you must choose the
					database software you will use to create the
					repository. You can create a repository using
					PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, or
					HSQLDB. If available, you can use a database server
					that already exists on your network. Otherwise,
					there is a wide range of free and commercial
					database platforms to choose from. If you have to
					install a new database and you're unsure which to
					choose, the Power*MatchMaker development team
					recommends PostgreSQL. It's robust, flexible,
					performs well, is easy to set up and administer, and
					it's free.

				</para>

				<para>

					Note: If you'd like to experiment with keeping the
					repository in a different type of database, contact

				Using Concurrent Sessions Within the Same Repository
			</title>

			<para>

				One of the main advantages of using a shared repository
				is that multiple Power*MatchMaker users can work within
				it at the same time. However, users must be careful not
				to overwrite changes made by others. To prevent this,
				each user should work on a different part of the
				project. For example, if you are working on one munge
				process and a co-worker is working on a different munge
				process within the same project, you will not interfere
				with each other. However, if you are both working on the
				same munge process, whoever saves last will "win,"
				trampling the other person's version of the same
				process.

			<title>Appendix A: GNU GPL Version 3</title>

			<para>
				The Power*MatchMaker is distributed under the terms of
				the GNU General Public License, version 3 or later. Here
				is the text of that license:
			</para>

			<para>
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				General Public License version 3
			</para>
			<para>Version 3, 29 June 2007</para>
			<para>
				Copyright &copy; 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
				<ulink url="http://fsf.org/">http://fsf.org/</ulink>
			</para>
			<para>
				Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim
				copies of this license document, but changing it is not
				allowed.
			</para>
			<para>Preamble</para>
			<para>
				The
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				General Public License is a free, copyleft license for
				software and other kinds of works.
			</para>
			<para>
				The licenses for most software and other practical works
				are designed to take away your freedom to share and
				change the works. By contrast, the
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				General Public License is intended to guarantee your
				freedom to share and change all versions of a
				program&mdash;to make sure it remains free software for
				all its users. We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				General Public License for most of our software; it
				applies also to any other work released this way by its
				authors. You can apply it to your programs, too.
			</para>
			<para>
				When we speak of free software, we are referring to
				freedom, not price. Our General Public Licenses are
				designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
				distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
				if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
				if you want it, that you can change the software or use
				pieces of it in new free programs, and that you know you
				can do these things.
			</para>
			<para>
				To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from
				denying you these rights or asking you to surrender the
				rights. Therefore, you have certain responsibilities if
				you distribute copies of the software, or if you modify
				it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
			</para>
			<para>
				For example, if you distribute copies of such a program,
				whether gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the
				recipients the same freedoms that you received. You must
				make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
				code. And you must show them these terms so they know
				their rights.
			</para>
			<para>
				Developers that use the
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				<acronym>GPL</acronym>
				protect your rights with two steps: (1) assert copyright
				on the software, and (2) offer you this License giving
				you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
				it.
			</para>
			<para>
				For the developers&rsquo; and authors&rsquo; protection,
				the
				<acronym>GPL</acronym>
				clearly explains that there is no warranty for this free
				software. For both users&rsquo; and authors&rsquo; sake,
				the
				<acronym>GPL</acronym>
				requires that modified versions be marked as changed, so
				that their problems will not be attributed erroneously
				to authors of previous versions.
			</para>
			<para>
				Some devices are designed to deny users access to
				install or run modified versions of the software inside
				them, although the manufacturer can do so. This is
				fundamentally incompatible with the aim of protecting
				users&rsquo; freedom to change the software. The
				systematic pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of
				products for individuals to use, which is precisely
				where it is most unacceptable. Therefore, we have
				designed this version of the
				<acronym>GPL</acronym>
				to prohibit the practice for those products. If such
				problems arise substantially in other domains, we stand
				ready to extend this provision to those domains in
				future versions of the
				<acronym>GPL</acronym>
				, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
			</para>
			<para>
				Finally, every program is threatened constantly by
				software patents. States should not allow patents to
				restrict development and use of software on
				general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish
				to avoid the special danger that patents applied to a
				free program could make it effectively proprietary. To
				prevent this, the
				<acronym>GPL</acronym>
				assures that patents cannot be used to render the
				program non-free.
			</para>
			<para>
				The precise terms and conditions for copying,
				distribution and modification follow.
			</para>
			<para>TERMS AND CONDITIONS</para>
			<para>0. Definitions.</para>
			<para>
				&ldquo;This License&rdquo; refers to version 3 of the
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				General Public License.
			</para>
			<para>
				&ldquo;Copyright&rdquo; also means copyright-like laws
				that apply to other kinds of works, such as
				semiconductor masks.
			</para>
			<para>
				&ldquo;The Program&rdquo; refers to any copyrightable
				work licensed under this License. Each licensee is
				addressed as &ldquo;you&rdquo;. &ldquo;Licensees&rdquo;
				and &ldquo;recipients&rdquo; may be individuals or
				organizations.
			</para>
			<para>
				To &ldquo;modify&rdquo; a work means to copy from or
				adapt all or part of the work in a fashion requiring
				copyright permission, other than the making of an exact
				copy. The resulting work is called a &ldquo;modified
				version&rdquo; of the earlier work or a work
				&ldquo;based on&rdquo; the earlier work.
			</para>
			<para>
				A &ldquo;covered work&rdquo; means either the unmodified
				Program or a work based on the Program.
			</para>
			<para>
				To &ldquo;propagate&rdquo; a work means to do anything
				with it that, without permission, would make you
				directly or secondarily liable for infringement under
				applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
				computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation
				includes copying, distribution (with or without
				modification), making available to the public, and in
				some countries other activities as well.
			</para>
			<para>
				To &ldquo;convey&rdquo; a work means any kind of
				propagation that enables other parties to make or
				receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through a
				computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not
				conveying.
			</para>
			<para>
				An interactive user interface displays
				&ldquo;Appropriate Legal Notices&rdquo; to the extent
				that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
				feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright
				notice, and (2) tells the user that there is no warranty
				for the work (except to the extent that warranties are
				provided), that licensees may convey the work under this
				License, and how to view a copy of this License. If the
				interface presents a list of user commands or options,
				such as a menu, a prominent item in the list meets this
				criterion.
			</para>
			<para>1. Source Code.</para>
			<para>
				The &ldquo;source code&rdquo; for a work means the
				preferred form of the work for making modifications to
				it. &ldquo;Object code&rdquo; means any non-source form
				of a work.
			</para>
			<para>
				A &ldquo;Standard Interface&rdquo; means an interface
				that either is an official standard defined by a
				recognized standards body, or, in the case of interfaces
				specified for a particular programming language, one
				that is widely used among developers working in that
				language.
			</para>
			<para>
				The &ldquo;System Libraries&rdquo; of an executable work
				include anything, other than the work as a whole, that
				(a) is included in the normal form of packaging a Major
				Component, but which is not part of that Major
				Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work
				with that Major Component, or to implement a Standard
				Interface for which an implementation is available to
				the public in source code form. A &ldquo;Major
				Component&rdquo;, in this context, means a major
				essential component (kernel, window system, and so on)
				of the specific operating system (if any) on which the
				executable work runs, or a compiler used to produce the
				work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
			</para>
			<para>
				The &ldquo;Corresponding Source&rdquo; for a work in
				object code form means all the source code needed to
				generate, install, and (for an executable work) run the
				object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
				control those activities. However, it does not include
				the work&rsquo;s System Libraries, or general-purpose
				tools or generally available free programs which are
				used unmodified in performing those activities but which
				are not part of the work. For example, Corresponding
				Source includes interface definition files associated
				with source files for the work, and the source code for
				shared libraries and dynamically linked subprograms that
				the work is specifically designed to require, such as by
				intimate data communication or control flow between
				those subprograms and other parts of the work.
			</para>
			<para>
				The Corresponding Source need not include anything that
				users can regenerate automatically from other parts of
				the Corresponding Source.
			</para>
			<para>
				The Corresponding Source for a work in source code form
				is that same work.
			</para>
			<para>2. Basic Permissions.</para>
			<para>
				All rights granted under this License are granted for
				the term of copyright on the Program, and are
				irrevocable provided the stated conditions are met. This
				License explicitly affirms your unlimited permission to
				run the unmodified Program. The output from running a
				covered work is covered by this License only if the
				output, given its content, constitutes a covered work.
				This License acknowledges your rights of fair use or
				other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
			</para>
			<para>
				You may make, run and propagate covered works that you
				do not convey, without conditions so long as your
				license otherwise remains in force. You may convey
				covered works to others for the sole purpose of having
				them make modifications exclusively for you, or provide
				you with facilities for running those works, provided
				that you comply with the terms of this License in
				conveying all material for which you do not control
				copyright. Those thus making or running the covered
				works for you must do so exclusively on your behalf,
				under your direction and control, on terms that prohibit
				them from making any copies of your copyrighted material
				outside their relationship with you.
			</para>
			<para>
				Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted
				solely under the conditions stated below. Sublicensing
				is not allowed; section 10 makes it unnecessary.
			</para>
			<para>
				3. Protecting Users&rsquo; Legal Rights From
				Anti-Circumvention Law.
			</para>
			<para>
				No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective
				technological measure under any applicable law
				fulfilling obligations under article 11 of the WIPO
				copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or similar
				laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
				measures.
			</para>
			<para>
				When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal
				power to forbid circumvention of technological measures
				to the extent such circumvention is effected by
				exercising rights under this License with respect to the
				covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit
				operation or modification of the work as a means of
				enforcing, against the work&rsquo;s users, your or third
				parties&rsquo; legal rights to forbid circumvention of
				technological measures.
			</para>
			<para>4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.</para>
			<para>
				You may convey verbatim copies of the Program&rsquo;s
				source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided
				that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each
				copy an appropriate copyright notice; keep intact all
				notices stating that this License and any non-permissive
				terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
				keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty;
				and give all recipients a copy of this License along
				with the Program.
			</para>
			<para>
				You may charge any price or no price for each copy that
				you convey, and you may offer support or warranty
				protection for a fee.
			</para>
			<para>5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.</para>
			<para>
				You may convey a work based on the Program, or the
				modifications to produce it from the Program, in the
				form of source code under the terms of section 4,
				provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
			</para>
			<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The work must carry prominent notices stating
						that you modified it, and giving a relevant
						date.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The work must carry prominent notices stating
						that it is released under this License and any
						conditions added under section 7. This
						requirement modifies the requirement in section
						4 to &ldquo;keep intact all notices&rdquo;.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						You must license the entire work, as a whole,
						under this License to anyone who comes into
						possession of a copy. This License will
						therefore apply, along with any applicable
						section 7 additional terms, to the whole of the
						work, and all its parts, regardless of how they
						are packaged. This License gives no permission
						to license the work in any other way, but it
						does not invalidate such permission if you have
						separately received it.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						If the work has interactive user interfaces,
						each must display Appropriate Legal Notices;
						however, if the Program has interactive
						interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal
						Notices, your work need not make them do so.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>
				A compilation of a covered work with other separate and
				independent works, which are not by their nature
				extensions of the covered work, and which are not
				combined with it such as to form a larger program, in or
				on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is
				called an &ldquo;aggregate&rdquo; if the compilation and
				its resulting copyright are not used to limit the access
				or legal rights of the compilation&rsquo;s users beyond
				what the individual works permit. Inclusion of a covered
				work in an aggregate does not cause this License to
				apply to the other parts of the aggregate.
			</para>
			<para>6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.</para>
			<para>
				You may convey a covered work in object code form under
				the terms of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also
				convey the machine-readable Corresponding Source under
				the terms of this License, in one of these ways:
			</para>
			<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a
						physical product (including a physical
						distribution medium), accompanied by the

						interchange.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a
						physical product (including a physical
						distribution medium), accompanied by a written
						offer, valid for at least three years and valid
						for as long as you offer spare parts or customer
						support for that product model, to give anyone
						who possesses the object code either (1) a copy
						of the Corresponding Source for all the software
						in the product that is covered by this License,
						on a durable physical medium customarily used
						for software interchange, for a price no more
						than your reasonable cost of physically
						performing this conveying of source, or (2)
						access to copy the Corresponding Source from a
						network server at no charge.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Convey individual copies of the object code with
						a copy of the written offer to provide the

					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						Convey the object code by offering access from a
						designated place (gratis or for a charge), and
						offer equivalent access to the Corresponding
						Source in the same way through the same place at
						no further charge. You need not require
						recipients to copy the Corresponding Source
						along with the object code. If the place to copy
						the object code is a network server, the
						Corresponding Source may be on a different
						server (operated by you or a third party) that
						supports equivalent copying facilities, provided
						you maintain clear directions next to the object
						code saying where to find the Corresponding
						Source. Regardless of what server hosts the
						Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to
						ensure that it is available for as long as
						needed to satisfy these requirements.
					</para>
				</listitem>
				<listitem>
					<para>

				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>
				A separable portion of the object code, whose source

			<para>
				A &ldquo;User Product&rdquo; is either (1) a
				&ldquo;consumer product&rdquo;, which means any tangible
				personal property which is normally used for personal,

				determining whether a product is a consumer product,
				doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.
				For a particular product received by a particular user,
				&ldquo;normally used&rdquo; refers to a typical or
				common use of that class of product, regardless of the
				status of the particular user or of the way in which the
				particular user actually uses, or expects or is expected
				to use, the product. A product is a consumer product
				regardless of whether the product has substantial
				commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such
				uses represent the only significant mode of use of the
				product.
			</para>
			<para>
				&ldquo;Installation Information&rdquo; for a User
				Product means any methods, procedures, authorization
				keys, or other information required to install and
				execute modified versions of a covered work in that User
				Product from a modified version of its Corresponding
				Source. The information must suffice to ensure that the
				continued functioning of the modified object code is in
				no case prevented or interfered with solely because
				modification has been made.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you convey an object code work under this section in,
				or with, or specifically for use in, a User Product, and
				the conveying occurs as part of a transaction in which
				the right of possession and use of the User Product is
				transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or for a
				fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is
				characterized), the Corresponding Source conveyed under
				this section must be accompanied by the Installation
				Information. But this requirement does not apply if
				neither you nor any third party retains the ability to
				install modified object code on the User Product (for
				example, the work has been installed in
				<acronym>ROM</acronym>
				).
			</para>
			<para>
				The requirement to provide Installation Information does
				not include a requirement to continue to provide support
				service, warranty, or updates for a work that has been
				modified or installed by the recipient, or for the User
				Product in which it has been modified or installed.
				Access to a network may be denied when the modification
				itself materially and adversely affects the operation of
				the network or violates the rules and protocols for
				communication across the network.
			</para>
			<para>
				Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation
				Information provided, in accord with this section must
				be in a format that is publicly documented (and with an
				implementation available to the public in source code
				form), and must require no special password or key for
				unpacking, reading or copying.
			</para>
			<para>7. Additional Terms.</para>
			<para>
				&ldquo;Additional permissions&rdquo; are terms that
				supplement the terms of this License by making
				exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
				Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire
				Program shall be treated as though they were included in
				this License, to the extent that they are valid under
				applicable law. If additional permissions apply only to
				part of the Program, that part may be used separately
				under those permissions, but the entire Program remains
				governed by this License without regard to the
				additional permissions.
			</para>
			<para>
				When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at
				your option remove any additional permissions from that
				copy, or from any part of it. (Additional permissions
				may be written to require their own removal in certain
				cases when you modify the work.) You may place
				additional permissions on material, added by you to a
				covered work, for which you have or can give appropriate
				copyright permission.
			</para>
			<para>
				Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, for
				material you add to a covered work, you may (if
				authorized by the copyright holders of that material)
				supplement the terms of this License with terms:
			</para>
			<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">
				<listitem>

						Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability
						differently from the terms of sections 15 and 16
						of this License; or

						recipient, for any liability that these
						contractual assumptions directly impose on those
						licensors and authors.
					</para>
				</listitem>
			</orderedlist>
			<para>
				All other non-permissive additional terms are considered
				&ldquo;further restrictions&rdquo; within the meaning of
				section 10. If the Program as you received it, or any
				part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
				governed by this License along with a term that is a
				further restriction, you may remove that term. If a
				license document contains a further restriction but
				permits relicensing or conveying under this License, you
				may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
				of that license document, provided that the further
				restriction does not survive such relicensing or
				conveying.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this
				section, you must place, in the relevant source files, a
				statement of the additional terms that apply to those
				files, or a notice indicating where to find the
				applicable terms.
			</para>
			<para>
				Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be
				stated in the form of a separately written license, or
				stated as exceptions; the above requirements apply
				either way.
			</para>
			<para>8. Termination.</para>
			<para>
				You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as
				expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
				otherwise to propagate or modify it is void, and will
				automatically terminate your rights under this License
				(including any patent licenses granted under the third
				paragraph of section 11).
			</para>
			<para>
				However, if you cease all violation of this License,
				then your license from a particular copyright holder is
				reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the
				copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your
				license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder
				fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable
				means prior to 60 days after the cessation.
			</para>
			<para>
				Moreover, your license from a particular copyright
				holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder
				notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means,
				this is the first time you have received notice of
				violation of this License (for any work) from that
				copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30
				days after your receipt of the notice.
			</para>
			<para>
				Termination of your rights under this section does not
				terminate the licenses of parties who have received
				copies or rights from you under this License. If your
				rights have been terminated and not permanently
				reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses
				for the same material under section 10.
			</para>
			<para>9. Acceptance Not Required for Having Copies.</para>
			<para>
				You are not required to accept this License in order to
				receive or run a copy of the Program. Ancillary
				propagation of a covered work occurring solely as a
				consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission to
				receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.
				However, nothing other than this License grants you
				permission to propagate or modify any covered work.
				These actions infringe copyright if you do not accept
				this License. Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
				covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this
				License to do so.
			</para>
			<para>
				10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
			</para>
			<para>
				Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient
				automatically receives a license from the original
				licensors, to run, modify and propagate that work,
				subject to this License. You are not responsible for
				enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
			</para>
			<para>
				An &ldquo;entity transaction&rdquo; is a transaction
				transferring control of an organization, or
				substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
				organization, or merging organizations. If propagation
				of a covered work results from an entity transaction,
				each party to that transaction who receives a copy of
				the work also receives whatever licenses to the work the
				party&rsquo;s predecessor in interest had or could give
				under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession
				of the Corresponding Source of the work from the
				predecessor in interest, if the predecessor has it or
				can get it with reasonable efforts.
			</para>
			<para>
				You may not impose any further restrictions on the
				exercise of the rights granted or affirmed under this
				License. For example, you may not impose a license fee,
				royalty, or other charge for exercise of rights granted
				under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
				(including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit)
				alleging that any patent claim is infringed by making,
				using, selling, offering for sale, or importing the
				Program or any portion of it.
			</para>
			<para>11. Patents.</para>
			<para>
				A &ldquo;contributor&rdquo; is a copyright holder who
				authorizes use under this License of the Program or a
				work on which the Program is based. The work thus
				licensed is called the contributor&rsquo;s
				&ldquo;contributor version&rdquo;.
			</para>
			<para>
				A contributor&rsquo;s &ldquo;essential patent
				claims&rdquo; are all patent claims owned or controlled
				by the contributor, whether already acquired or
				hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some
				manner, permitted by this License, of making, using, or
				selling its contributor version, but do not include
				claims that would be infringed only as a consequence of
				further modification of the contributor version. For
				purposes of this definition, &ldquo;control&rdquo;
				includes the right to grant patent sublicenses in a
				manner consistent with the requirements of this License.
			</para>
			<para>
				Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide,
				royalty-free patent license under the
				contributor&rsquo;s essential patent claims, to make,
				use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run,
				modify and propagate the contents of its contributor
				version.
			</para>
			<para>
				In the following three paragraphs, a &ldquo;patent
				license&rdquo; is any express agreement or commitment,
				however denominated, not to enforce a patent (such as an
				express permission to practice a patent or covenant not
				to sue for patent infringement). To &ldquo;grant&rdquo;
				such a patent license to a party means to make such an
				agreement or commitment not to enforce a patent against
				the party.
			</para>
			<para>
				If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a
				patent license, and the Corresponding Source of the work
				is not available for anyone to copy, free of charge and
				under the terms of this License, through a publicly
				available network server or other readily accessible
				means, then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding
				Source to be so available, or (2) arrange to deprive
				yourself of the benefit of the patent license for this
				particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner consistent
				with the requirements of this License, to extend the
				patent license to downstream recipients.
				&ldquo;Knowingly relying&rdquo; means you have actual
				knowledge that, but for the patent license, your
				conveying the covered work in a country, or your
				recipient&rsquo;s use of the covered work in a country,
				would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
				country that you have reason to believe are valid.
			</para>
			<para>
				If, pursuant to or in connection with a single
				transaction or arrangement, you convey, or propagate by
				procuring conveyance of, a covered work, and grant a
				patent license to some of the parties receiving the
				covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
				or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the
				patent license you grant is automatically extended to
				all recipients of the covered work and works based on
				it.
			</para>
			<para>
				A patent license is &ldquo;discriminatory&rdquo; if it
				does not include within the scope of its coverage,
				prohibits the exercise of, or is conditioned on the
				non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
				specifically granted under this License. You may not
				convey a covered work if you are a party to an
				arrangement with a third party that is in the business
				of distributing software, under which you make payment
				to the third party based on the extent of your activity
				of conveying the work, and under which the third party
				grants, to any of the parties who would receive the
				covered work from you, a discriminatory patent license
				(a) in connection with copies of the covered work
				conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or
				(b) primarily for and in connection with specific
				products or compilations that contain the covered work,
				unless you entered into that arrangement, or that patent
				license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
			</para>
			<para>
				Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding
				or limiting any implied license or other defenses to
				infringement that may otherwise be available to you
				under applicable patent law.
			</para>
			<para>12. No Surrender of Others&rsquo; Freedom.</para>
			<para>
				If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court
				order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the
				conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from
				the conditions of this License. If you cannot convey a
				covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your
				obligations under this License and any other pertinent
				obligations, then as a consequence you may not convey it
				at all. For example, if you agree to terms that obligate
				you to collect a royalty for further conveying from
				those to whom you convey the Program, the only way you
				could satisfy both those terms and this License would be
				to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
			</para>
			<para>
				13. Use with the
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				Affero General Public License.
			</para>
			<para>
				Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you
				have permission to link or combine any covered work with
				a work licensed under version 3 of the
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				Affero General Public License into a single combined
				work, and to convey the resulting work. The terms of
				this License will continue to apply to the part which is
				the covered work, but the special requirements of the
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				Affero General Public License, section 13, concerning
				interaction through a network will apply to the
				combination as such.
			</para>
			<para>14. Revised Versions of this License.</para>
			<para>
				The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or
				new versions of the
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				General Public License from time to time. Such new
				versions will be similar in spirit to the present
				version, but may differ in detail to address new
				problems or concerns.
			</para>
			<para>
				Each version is given a distinguishing version number.
				If the Program specifies that a certain numbered version
				of the
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				General Public License &ldquo;or any later
				version&rdquo; applies to it, you have the option of
				following the terms and conditions either of that
				numbered version or of any later version published by
				the Free Software Foundation. If the Program does not
				specify a version number of the
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				General Public License, you may choose any version ever
				published by the Free Software Foundation.
			</para>
			<para>
				If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which
				future versions of the
				<acronym>GNU</acronym>
				General Public License can be used, that proxy&rsquo;s
				public statement of acceptance of a version permanently
				authorizes you to choose that version for the Program.
			</para>
			<para>
				Later license versions may give you additional or
				different permissions. However, no additional
				obligations are imposed on any author or copyright
				holder as a result of your choosing to follow a later
				version.
			</para>
			<para>15. Disclaimer of Warranty.</para>
			<para>
				THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT
				PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
				STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER
				PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &ldquo;AS IS&rdquo; WITHOUT
				WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
				INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
				MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
				THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
				PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
				YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR
				OR CORRECTION.
			</para>
			<para>16. Limitation of Liability.</para>
			<para>
				IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED
				TO IN WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER
				PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS THE PROGRAM AS
				PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING
				ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL
				DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
				PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR
				DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
				YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO
				OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR
				OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
				DAMAGES.
			</para>
			<para>17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.</para>
			<para>
				If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
				liability provided above cannot be given local legal
				effect according to their terms, reviewing courts shall
				apply local law that most closely approximates an
				absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection
				with the Program, unless a warranty or assumption of
				liability accompanies a copy of the Program in return
				for a fee.
			</para>
			<para>END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</para>
			<para>How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs</para>
			<para>
				If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of
				the greatest possible use to the public, the best way to
				achieve this is to make it free software which everyone
				can redistribute and change under these terms.
			</para>
			<para>
				To do so, attach the following notices to the program.
				It is safest to attach them to the start of each source
				file to most effectively state the exclusion of
				warranty; and each file should have at least the
				&ldquo;copyright&rdquo; line and a pointer to where the
				full notice is found.

				</para>
				<para>3. Distribution Obligations.</para>
				<para>
					3.1. Application of License. The Modifications which
					You create or to which You contribute are governed
					by the terms of this License, including without
					limitation Section 2.2. The Source Code version of
					Covered Code may be distributed only under the terms
					of this License or a future version of this License
					released under Section 6.1, and You must include a
					copy of this License with every copy of the Source
					Code You distribute. You may not offer or impose any
					terms on any Source Code version that alters or
					restricts the applicable version of this License or
					the recipients' rights hereunder. However, You may
					include an additional document offering the
					additional rights described in Section 3.5.
				</para>
				<para>
					3.2. Availability of Source Code. Any Modification
					which You create or to which You contribute must be
					made available in Source Code form under the terms
					of this License either on the same media as an
					Executable version or via an accepted Electronic
					Distribution Mechanism to anyone to whom you made an
					Executable version available; and if made available
					via Electronic Distribution Mechanism, must remain
					available for at least twelve (12) months after the
					date it initially became available, or at least six
					(6) months after a subsequent version of that
					particular Modification has been made available to
					such recipients. You are responsible for ensuring
					that the Source Code version remains available even
					if the Electronic Distribution Mechanism is
					maintained by a third party.
				</para>
				<para>
					3.3. Description of Modifications. You must cause
					all Covered Code to which You contribute to contain
					a file documenting the changes You made to create
					that Covered Code and the date of any change. You
					must include a prominent statement that the
					Modification is derived, directly or indirectly,
					from Original Code provided by the Initial Developer
					and including the name of the Initial Developer in
					(a) the Source Code, and (b) in any notice in an
					Executable version or related documentation in which
					You describe the origin or ownership of the Covered
					Code.
				</para>
				<para>
					3.4. Intellectual Property Matters (a) Third Party
					Claims. If Contributor has knowledge that a license
					under a third party's intellectual property rights
					is required to exercise the rights granted by such
					Contributor under Sections 2.1 or 2.2, Contributor
					must include a text file with the Source Code
					distribution titled "LEGAL" which describes the
					claim and the party making the claim in sufficient
					detail that a recipient will know whom to contact.
					If Contributor obtains such knowledge after the
					Modification is made available as described in
					Section 3.2, Contributor shall promptly modify the
					LEGAL file in all copies Contributor makes available
					thereafter and shall take other steps (such as
					notifying appropriate mailing lists or newsgroups)
					reasonably calculated to inform those who received
					the Covered Code that new knowledge has been
					obtained.
				</para>
				<para>
					(b) Contributor APIs. If Contributor's Modifications
					include an application programming interface and
					Contributor has knowledge of patent licenses which
					are reasonably necessary to implement that API,
					Contributor must also include this information in
					the LEGAL file.
				</para>
				<para>
					(c) Representations. Contributor represents that,
					except as disclosed pursuant to Section 3.4(a)
					above, Contributor believes that Contributor's
					Modifications are Contributor's original creation(s)
					and/or Contributor has sufficient rights to grant
					the rights conveyed by this License.
				</para>
				<para>
					3.5. Required Notices. You must duplicate the notice
					in Exhibit A in each file of the Source Code. If it
					is not possible to put such notice in a particular
					Source Code file due to its structure, then You must
					include such notice in a location (such as a
					relevant directory) where a user would be likely to
					look for such a notice. If You created one or more
					Modification(s) You may add your name as a
					Contributor to the notice described in Exhibit A.
					You must also duplicate this License in any
					documentation for the Source Code where You describe
					recipients' rights or ownership rights relating to
					Covered Code. You may choose to offer, and to charge
					a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or liability
					obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
					Code. However, You may do so only on Your own
					behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial Developer
					or any Contributor. You must make it absolutely
					clear than any such warranty, support, indemnity or
					liability obligation is offered by You alone, and
					You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
					and every Contributor for any liability incurred by
					the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a
					result of warranty, support, indemnity or liability
					terms You offer.
				</para>
				<para>
					3.6. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may
					distribute Covered Code in Executable form only if
					the requirements of Section 3.1-3.5 have been met
					for that Covered Code, and if You include a notice
					stating that the Source Code version of the Covered
					Code is available under the terms of this License,
					including a description of how and where You have
					fulfilled the obligations of Section 3.2. The notice
					must be conspicuously included in any notice in an
					Executable version, related documentation or
					collateral in which You describe recipients' rights
					relating to the Covered Code. You may distribute the
					Executable version of Covered Code or ownership
					rights under a license of Your choice, which may
					contain terms different from this License, provided
					that You are in compliance with the terms of this
					License and that the license for the Executable
					version does not attempt to limit or alter the
					recipient's rights in the Source Code version from
					the rights set forth in this License. If You
					distribute the Executable version under a different
					license You must make it absolutely clear that any
					terms which differ from this License are offered by
					You alone, not by the Initial Developer or any
					Contributor. You hereby agree to indemnify the
					Initial Developer and every Contributor for any
					liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
					Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.
				</para>
				<para>
					3.7. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by
					combining Covered Code with other code not governed
					by the terms of this License and distribute the
					Larger Work as a single product. In such a case, You
					must make sure the requirements of this License are
					fulfilled for the Covered Code.
				</para>
				<para>
					4. Inability to Comply Due to Statute or Regulation.
				</para>
				<para>
					If it is impossible for You to comply with any of
					the terms of this License with respect to some or
					all of the Covered Code due to statute, judicial
					order, or regulation then You must: (a) comply with
					the terms of this License to the maximum extent
					possible; and (b) describe the limitations and the
					code they affect. Such description must be included
					in the LEGAL file described in Section 3.4 and must
					be included with all distributions of the Source
					Code. Except to the extent prohibited by statute or
					regulation, such description must be sufficiently
					detailed for a recipient of ordinary skill to be
					able to understand it.
				</para>
				<para>5. Application of this License.</para>
				<para>
					This License applies to code to which the Initial
					Developer has attached the notice in Exhibit A and
					to related Covered Code.
				</para>
				<para>6. Versions of the License.</para>
				<para>
					6.1. New Versions. Netscape Communications
					Corporation ("Netscape") may publish revised and/or
					new versions of the License from time to time. Each
					version will be given a distinguishing version
					number.
				</para>
				<para>
					6.2. Effect of New Versions. Once Covered Code has
					been published under a particular version of the
					License, You may always continue to use it under the
					terms of that version. You may also choose to use
					such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent
					version of the License published by Netscape. No one
					other than Netscape has the right to modify the
					terms applicable to Covered Code created under this
					License.
				</para>
				<para>
					6.3. Derivative Works. If You create or use a
					modified version of this License (which you may only
					do in order to apply it to code which is not already
					Covered Code governed by this License), You must (a)
					rename Your license so that the phrases "Mozilla",
					"MOZILLAPL", "MOZPL", "Netscape", "MPL", "NPL" or
					any confusingly similar phrase do not appear in your
					license (except to note that your license differs
					from this License) and (b) otherwise make it clear
					that Your version of the license contains terms
					which differ from the Mozilla Public License and
					Netscape Public License. (Filling in the name of the
					Initial Developer, Original Code or Contributor in
					the notice described in Exhibit A shall not of
					themselves be deemed to be modifications of this
					License.)

					OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN
					INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS
					LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY
					FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
					PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW
					PROHIBITS SUCH LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT
					ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR

					License with every copy of the Source Code form of
					the Covered Software You distribute or otherwise
					make available. You must inform recipients of any
					such Covered Software in Executable form as to how
					they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code
					form in a reasonable manner on or through a medium
					customarily used for software exchange.

					Developer.
				</para>
				<para>

					rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, and to
					charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
					liability obligations to one or more recipients of
					Covered Software. However, you may do so only on
					Your own behalf, and not on behalf of the Initial
					Developer or any Contributor. You must make it
					absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
					indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
					alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial
					Developer and every Contributor for any liability
					incurred by the Initial Developer or such
					Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
					indemnity or liability terms You offer.

					that You are in compliance with the terms of this
					License and that the license for the Executable form

					to modify this License.
				</para>
				<para>
					4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue
					to use, distribute or otherwise make the Covered
					Software available under the terms of the version of
					the License under which You originally received the
					Covered Software. If the Initial Developer includes

					from being distributed or otherwise made available
					under any subsequent version of the License, You
					must distribute and make the Covered Software
					available under the terms of the version of the
					License under which You originally received the

					Software available under the terms of any subsequent
