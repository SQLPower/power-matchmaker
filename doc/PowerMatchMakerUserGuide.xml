			Data needs to be contained, clean and complete to be useful
			in today's workplace. The Power*MatchMaker is the tool that
			allows you to get a consolidated view of your customers,
			products or other key dimensions. This tool will help to
			provide you with clean data, build connections between
			disconnected data sources and to provide a single view for
			each customer, product or person by creating conformed
			dimensions. The Power*Matchmaker can even deal with
			different source systems that use different identifiers for
			the same customer, product or person.
		</para>

		<para>
			Power*Matchmaker allows you to successfully build conformed
			dimensions which results in having concise and complete
			views of key dimensions. This aids executives and
			decision-makers in seeing the complete picture and allows
			them to make informed decisions based on the entire set of
			available data. The Power*MatchMaker builds conformed
			dimensions and eliminates duplicates from your database.
		</para>

		<para>
			The Power*Matchmaker is a user-friendly and highly intuitive
			data consolidating tool. The tool is created by data
			warehouse designers, and has many features geared for anyone
			dealing with data, including:

				<title>Drivers</title>
				<para>
					Most programs need a distinct driver program to
					communicate with each different type of database.
					The Power*Matchmaker uses Java-based drivers, which
					normally come from the database vendor in the form
					of "JAR"
					<footnote>
						<para>
							Java Archive files; these are an extension
							to the file format used by PKZip/WinZip
							archives
						</para>
					</footnote>
					files. You need to inform Power*Matchmaker about
					each driver before you can use it; do this from the
					JDBC Drivers window that can be accessed from the
					Database Connection Manager window. If you do not
					have the JDBC driver for a given database, you can
					usually obtain one from the database vendor. If that
					fails, you can find a directory of databases drivers
					on
					<ulink
						url="http://developers.sun.com/product/jdbc/drivers">

				The tie-in between Drivers and Connections might seem a
				bit indirect if you are not used to using Java JDBC. In
				this section you are telling the Power*MatchMaker where
				the drivers are so that they can be used when necessary.
				Definition of the database type must be completed before
				a new database connection can be configured.
			</para>

			<para>
				Clicking on the Manage Connections... button will open
				the Database Connection Manager window. In this window
				click on JBDC drivers button to define a database
				connection. The JDBC drivers window will appear as shown
				below.

				</inlinemediaobject>
			</para>

			<para>
				The column on the left hand side contains a list of
				pre-defined database connection types. To connect to one
				of the pre-defined database connections you must first
				tell Power*Matchmaker where to find the JAR file.
				Highlight the desired database type in the left column,
				click on the Add JAR... button, and navigate to the
				correct JAR file for the database type. The Add JAR...
				and Remove JAR buttons are used to point the
				Power*Matchmaker to the locations of the JAR files that
				contain the proper JDBC Driver. Once, you select a JAR
				file, if there is a valid driver in it, a file tree will
				appear in the area below the buttons. This is a
				representation of the JAR file and its JDBC contents.
				Select the driver you wish to use and click the "OK"
				button at the bottom.
			</para>

				To edit the properties of the drivers click on the item
				in the list and edit the fields to the right. If you
				wish to create a database type that is not
				pre-defined,click on the + button in the lower left
				corner of the window. Type in the name of the Database
				connection, the Driver Class, and the Connection String
				Template (i.e. jbdc:...).
			</para>

			<itemizedlist>
				<listitem>
					<para>
						The "Name" field is used to assign a name to the

			<para>
				<emphasis>Connection String Template</emphasis>
				Used to define a URL template. The URL template is used
				by the Power*MatchMaker to create a URL that is used to
				attempt a database connection. The pattern that the
				string must conform to is not trivial but is made up of
				two simpler parts, literals and variables. Literals are
				entered like normal text but may not contain angle
				brackets (&lt; or &gt;) because they are reserved for
				defining variables. As their name implies, literals
				appear in the URL in the same position and way they
				appear in the template. Variables are used to make it
				easier for things that change such as the schema or
				database name you wish to connect to. They are defined
				in the template by
				"&lt;variable_name:default_value&gt;". Once a variable
				is defined in the template, a field labeled with the
				variable's name will appear below with the default value
				in it just below the template as a preview to what you
				will later be able to modify in "Connection Properties".
			</para>

			<para>
				Note: Default values are often useful, but are optional.
				If you do not want a variable to have a default value,
				define it as "&lt;variable_name&gt;". The default value
				for these variables is blank. For example, if we wanted
				to connect to a Microsoft SQL Server database, the URL
				template might look like
				"jdbc:sqlserver://&lt;Hostname&gt;:&lt;Port:1433&gt;".
				The URL this template will output is
				"jdbc:sqlserver://:1433" where the 1433 was a default
				value. If we were to enter "localhost" in the Hostname
				field, we would get the URL
				"jdbc:sqlserver://localhost:1433". By defining the
				"Hostname" variable, we make it easier and quicker to
				connect to a generic SQL Server instance. SQL Server
				databases listen to port 1433 by default but can be
				configured to listen to others so, by giving the
				variable this default, we can have the most common value
				inserted automatically while allowing us to modify what
				is in the field to change the port in specific cases.

						As a simple start, drag the peg under HomePhone
						in the input step into the plug in the output
						step. This would match all records in the table
						that have the exact same home phone number. This

						there are many ways to enter a phone number and

						To counter this problem we can add a Munge Step.
						Bring the

						Munge Step into the Munge Pen. This can be done

						by right clicking in the Munge Pen and selecting

						Connect the HomePhone peg in the input step to

						there phone numbers regardless of how they were

					<para>
						At the bottom there is a

						Now that some of the records have been matched

						can define child and grandchild tables, that

				<listitem>
					<para>
						Click on the example table's name in the tree in

						when merging two records for each column. For
						this example "Augment nulls" will be fine as it
						will leave all of the master record's columns
						alone except if they have nulls, which it will
						try to fill in the missing data from the

				</listitem>
				<listitem>

						Now to finally run the merge and update the data

				<title>New De-dupe Project</title>

				<para>
					De-dupe projects are used to find duplicates of
					records in a table. For example if a customer
					database contained information on a Joe Smith and a
					Joeseph Smith, this project would help you determine
					if that customer was the same person and merge them
					if they are. There are 3 basic steps to create this
					type of Match project; 1. Define Munge Processes, 2.
					Run the engine, 3. Validate Matches.
