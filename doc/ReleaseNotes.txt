0.9.1

* Fixed a serious bug that prevented creating a new repository schema.
* When all the input connections for a Munge Step are used up, an empty one is automatically generated if the step supports
  adding new inputs. Unconnected inputs for these steps are now treated as if they didn't exist, so that the use isn't
  forced to clean up these inputs before running the engines.
* Fixed a bug that could result in the MatchMaker using up all available database connections.
* Temporarily removed the X-Ref project option until it is fully implemented.
* In the Match Validation screen, the source table record for the node you have selected in the graph will not scroll 
  off the screen when you scroll through the source table records. This makes it easier to compare the record you have
  selected with the other potential duplicate records.

0.9.0

* Initial open-source release
